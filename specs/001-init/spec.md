# Feature Specification: Speech-to-Subtitle Editor Core

**Feature Branch**: `[###-feature-name]`  
**Created**: [DATE]  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "$ARGUMENTS"

## Overview

A web-based subtitle editor that allows YouTube creators to generate, edit, and export subtitles from their video/audio content. The application prioritizes simplicity and usability while maintaining a minimalist interface focused on efficient subtitle editing workflows.

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

<!--
  IMPORTANT: User stories should be PRIORITIZED as user journeys ordered by importance.
  Each user story/journey must be INDEPENDENTLY TESTABLE - meaning if you implement just ONE of them,
  you should still have a viable MVP (Minimum Viable Product) that delivers value.
  
  Assign priorities (P1, P2, P3, etc.) to each story, where P1 is the most critical.
  Think of each story as a standalone slice of functionality that can be:
  - Developed independently
  - Tested independently
  - Deployed independently
  - Demonstrated to users independently
-->

### User Story 1 - Upload and Generate Subtitles (Priority: P1)

As a YouTube creator, I want to upload my video or audio file so that the system can automatically generate subtitles, saving me time on manual transcription.

**Why this priority**: This is the core functionality of the application, allowing users to quickly obtain a transcript of their media.

**Independent Test**: This can be tested independently by uploading a file and checking if subtitles are generated.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a video file, **When** I upload the file, **Then** subtitles should be generated automatically.
2. **Given** an audio file, **When** I upload the file, **Then** subtitles should be generated automatically.

---

### User Story 2 - Edit Subtitles (Priority: P2)

As a user, I want to edit the generated subtitles for accuracy and timing, so that they correctly match my video or audio content.

**Why this priority**: Editing is crucial for ensuring the quality and correctness of subtitles.

**Independent Test**: This can be tested by editing a subtitle and checking if the changes are saved and reflected in the export.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** generated subtitles, **When** I edit a subtitle, **Then** the changes should be saved.
2. **Given** edited subtitles, **When** I play the audio, **Then** the subtitles should match the audio timing.

---

### User Story 3 - Export Subtitles (Priority: P3)

As a user, I want to export the edited subtitles in various formats, so that I can use them in different video editing software or upload them directly to YouTube.

**Why this priority**: Exporting is necessary for users to utilize the subtitles outside of the application.

**Independent Test**: This can be tested by exporting subtitles in different formats and checking the file for correctness.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** edited subtitles, **When** I choose to export, **Then** I should be able to select the export format.
2. **Given** a selected export format, **When** I export the subtitles, **Then** the file should be downloaded in the chosen format.

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*

- **AudioFile**: Represents an uploaded audio or video file.
  - **Attributes**:
    - `id`: Unique identifier for the file.
    - `duration`: Length of the audio/video in seconds.
    - `format`: File format (e.g., MP3, MP4).
    - `url`: Location of the file.

- **Subtitle**: Represents a segment of subtitle text.
  - **Attributes**:
    - `id`: Unique identifier for the subtitle.
    - `text`: The subtitle text.
    - `startTime`: When the subtitle should appear, in seconds.
    - `endTime`: When the subtitle should disappear, in seconds.
    - `speaker`: Optional identifier for the speaker.

- **Timeline**: Represents the subtitle timeline and waveform.
  - **Attributes**:
    - `zoom`: Current zoom level of the timeline.

- Language detection automatic
- User can manually override detected language

## Technical Considerations

While avoiding implementation details, the system should consider:

- Undo/redo capability.
- Auto-save functionality.

## Future Considerations

- Multi-language support.
- Speaker detection.
- Cloud storage integration.
- Collaborative editing.
